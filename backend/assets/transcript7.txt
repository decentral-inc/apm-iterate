Duration: Condensed representation of a 22-minute session.

Transcript: Analytics & Insights Discovery Test
[00:00] PM: Chris, your job is to find actionable engagement insights today. Use the tool however you naturally would and think out loud.

[00:30] Chris: Alright. I'm on the analytics page. I see an overview with total users, DAU, WAU, MAU. Good starting point. DAU is 2,300, MAU is 8,500. So our DAU/MAU ratio is 27%. That's actually below our target of 35%.

[01:15] Chris: I want to see which user segment has the worst engagement. Is there a segmentation view? I see "Segments" in the sidebar. Clicking… okay, pre-built segments: "Enterprise," "Mid-Market," "SMB," "Free Tier."

[01:50] Chris: I'll compare Enterprise vs SMB. Clicking Enterprise… DAU/MAU is 42%. Nice. SMB… 18%. Huge gap. But I already knew that intuitively. What I need is to understand WHY the gap exists.

[02:30] Chris: Can I see what features Enterprise users use that SMB users don't? Is there a feature adoption comparison? I'm looking for something like "Feature used" by segment…

[03:00] Chris: I don't see a feature comparison. There's "Top Features" which shows overall feature usage, but no breakdown by segment. This is where Mixpanel excels — I can do that in two clicks there.

[03:40] PM: What would you need to see to answer the "why" question?

[03:50] Chris: A feature adoption matrix. Rows are features, columns are segments. Each cell shows adoption percentage. Color-coded — green for high adoption, red for low. Then I can instantly see: "Ah, Enterprise uses 'Team Dashboards' at 78% but SMB is at 12%. That's the gap."

[04:30] Chris: Let me try cohort analysis. I want to see Week 1 retention by signup month. Is there a cohort view? Searching… I see "Retention" in sidebar. Clicking…

[05:00] Chris: It shows overall retention: Day 1 is 65%, Day 7 is 40%, Day 30 is 22%. That's useful but generic. I need cohort rows — January signups, February signups, etc. — to see if our recent changes improved retention.

[05:45] Chris: No cohort table. This is a deal-breaker for my use case. Cohort analysis is literally the first thing I do every Monday morning. Without it, I'm staying on Mixpanel.

[06:30] PM: What about export? Could you export data and build cohorts yourself?

[06:40] Chris: Let me try export. I see a download button… CSV export. Clicked… "Export failed: too many rows. Upgrade to Pro for full exports." I'm on the Team plan. I can't even get my own data out?

[07:15] Chris: That's frustrating. I understand pricing tiers, but gating data export feels punitive. At least let me export the aggregated view, not just raw data.

[08:00] PM: What would make you recommend this to your team and consider replacing Mixpanel?

[08:10] Chris: Cohort analysis, feature adoption by segment, and ungated CSV exports. If you had those three, I could justify dropping Mixpanel which costs us $300/month. Right now I'd use your tool as a supplement, but it can't be my primary analytics.

[09:00] PM: Rating the analytics experience, 1 to 5?

[09:10] Chris: A 2.5. The data is there, the UI is fast, and the pre-built segments are helpful. But the analysis tools are shallow. It feels like analytics-lite. For a $10/month tool, fine. For $89/month, I expect depth.

Key Insights for Product Manager
Friction Point 1 (Feature Adoption): No per-segment feature comparison. Action: Build feature adoption matrix with segment columns.

Friction Point 2 (Cohort Analysis): Missing cohort retention table. Action: Prioritize cohort analysis view — it's a core workflow for growth teams.

Friction Point 3 (Export Gating): CSV export blocked on Team plan. Action: Allow aggregated exports on all plans; gate only raw row-level exports.

Bottom Line Impact: Mixpanel replacement opportunity: $300/month. Cohort analysis is a Monday-morning workflow — its absence makes the tool supplementary, not primary.
